1.1.1. PAs are entities that facilitate e-commerce sites and merchants to accept various payment instruments from the customers for completion of their payment obligations without the need for merchants to create a separate payment integration system of their own. PAs facilitate merchants to connect with acquirers. In the process, they receive payments from customers, pool and transfer them on to the merchants after a time period.

1.1.2. PGs are entities that provide technology infrastructure to route and facilitate processing of an online payment transaction without any involvement in handling of funds.

1.2. In the processing of an online transaction the following timelines are involved:

‘Tp’ – date of charge / debit to the customer’s account against the purchase of goods / services.

‘Ts’ – date of intimation by the merchant to the intermediary about shipment of goods.

‘Td’ – date of confirmation by the merchant to the intermediary about delivery of goods to the customer.

‘Tr’ – date of expiry of refund period as fixed by the merchant
